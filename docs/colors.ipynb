    "## The `Color` class\n",
    "\n",
    "The `Color` class defines a *single color* in the Flexoki system. Each `Color` will have the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `name`: The string name of the color, generally of the form `hue-lightness` (with a dash `-` separating the two). This string name can be used to access the color using dictionary-style retrieval (see below). Example: `red-150`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `h`: The hue of the color, using a single character for representation. This is intuitive for most colors (`r` for reds, `g` for greens), but the values spanning `paper` to `black` (referred to as `grey`, `gray`, or `base`) are represented by a `k`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `l`: The lightness value of the color, as an integer. While technically spanning `0` to `1000`, these two values represent `paper` (white) and `black` respectively, so most values with an actual color to them will span `50` to `950`, with increments of either 50 or 100. Note that not all lightness values are assigned! Ex. `550` is not used, even though `150` and `850` are. Refer to the Flexoki documentation for details.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `hex`: The hex code of the color, represented as a string of the form `#RRGGBB`. Note that this is stored on its own, and is not dynamically computed from the `rgb` value!\n",
    "\n",
    "- `rgb`: A tuple with a length of three, representing the red, green, and blue values of the color, with each being an integer. Note that this is stored on its own, and is not dynamically computed from the `hex` value!"
